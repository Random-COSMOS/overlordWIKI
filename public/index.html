        <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
        <p>
            In the year 2138, where the era of virtual reality gaming is thriving with different DMMO-RPGs, gamers used
            what was called the Neural Nano-Interface which enabled them to get the experience in playing it. At the
            center of its popularity and heydays, was YGGDRASIL which garnered the most attention publicly. Within the
            game exists a guild organization known as, Ainz Ooal Gown, originally consisting of 41 members and credited
            as one of the top strongest guilds. Now with only 4 of the members left remaining in the guild, the other 37
            were said to have given up on the game and quit it in the end. Before a majority of his companions gone
            offline forever since, they gave away all of their precious equipment and items respectively to none other
            than their guild leader Momonga himself. Momonga, was considered to be the one and only guild member around
            who continues to actively play YGGDRASIL, dedicating his heart and soul to what he loved most. For starters,
            he spent most of his hours and money maintaining their headquarters, which is the Great Tomb of Nazarick
            they worked so hard together to design in the past. After an intense 12-year run, YGGDRASIL, the online game
            lost the vibrancy it once have and eventually, it was scheduled to be shut down in due time.
            During the final day, Momonga considerately send out several invitations to the remaining guild members who
            are semi-active. However, among those that did come apart from Momonga, only one happens to answer his
            friend's invite when nobody else did, deciding to appear and stick with him for a short while longer before
            logging off. Though saddened by the fact that they had to part ways, he accepts the grim reality that his
            friends have real life situations to take care of above all than spend time playing video game. As the last
            sole player in the guild who was online, Momonga decided to continue staying logged on for the remainder of
            the game's time left, choosing to fall asleep within the Throne Room until the server automatically boot him
            out. After the game finally shuts down, Momonga later awoke to find himself still in the form of his
            heteromorphic avatar, an Overlord and a very powerful magic caster. Within Nazarick, he was then met with
            NPCs who suddenly shown to have a consciousness of their own right in front of him. In other words, he was
            actually transported into an entirely different New World as its own separate reality along with the various
            NPCs in Nazarick who have been brought to life after the transfer.

            Realizing the state and situation he is in where it's no longer a game, Momonga effortlessly tried his
            attempts in using player functions, such as the chat, a GM call, or even a forced logout, but none of them
            seem to be accessible whatsoever anymore. With no other options left, Momonga deliberates the idea of
            setting out on a long-term quest to learn whether anyone from YGGDRASIL had been sent into this New World
            besides him, refusing to believe that he was the only player to have been transported after experiencing the
            end of YGGDRASIL. Realizing what his next course of action will be: Having no parents, friends, or place in
            society, this ordinary young man, Momonga has made it his objective to go outside the underground tomb to
            explore, investigate and conquer the vast unknown new world with the help of his subordinates from Nazarick.
            He goes by the name of Ainz Ooal Gown as a sign of respect to not only represent his former guild members
            who aren't there with him, but to also sent a clear message to any other players out there besides himself
            that may happen to recognize the so-called player. Momonga step foot outside Nazarick and begun his
            exploration of the surrounding uncharted lands and regions in an attempt to figure out what has been
            transpiring until now. He search for anyone or anything that could help him unraveled the mystery of this
            world's magical norms and rules which sets it apart uniquely from YGGDRASIL.
