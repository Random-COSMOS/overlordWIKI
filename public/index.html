                The final hour of the popular virtual reality game Yggdrasil has come. However,
                <a href="/characters/ainz">Momonga</a>,
                a powerfulwizard and master of the dark guild Ainz Ooal Gown, decides to spend his last few moments in
                the game as
                the servers begin to shut down. To his surprise, despite the clock having struck midnight,
                <a href="/characters/ainz">Momonga</a> is
                still fully conscious as his character and, moreover, the non-player characters appear to have developed
                personalities of their own!
            </p>
            <p>
                Confronted with this abnormal situation, <a href="/characters/ainz">Momonga</a> commands his loyal
                servants to help him investigate and
                take control of this new world, with the hopes of figuring out what has caused this development and if
                there may be others in the same predicament.

        <article class="desktop">
            <p>
                In the year 2138, where the era of virtual reality gaming is thriving with different DMMO-RPGs, gamers
                used what was called the Neural Nano-Interface which enabled them to get the experience in playing it.
                At the center of its popularity and heydays, was YGGDRASIL which garnered the most attention publicly.
                Within the game exists a guild organization known as, Ainz Ooal Gown, originally consisting of 41
                members and credited as one of the top strongest guilds. Now with only 4 of the members left remaining
                in the guild, the other 37 were said to have given up on the game and quit it in the end. Before a
                majority of his companions gone offline forever since, they gave away all of their precious equipment
                and items respectively to none other than their guild leader <a href="/characters/ainz">Momonga</a>
                himself. <a href="/characters/ainz">Momonga</a>, was considered to
                be the one and only guild member around who continues to actively play YGGDRASIL, dedicating his heart
                and soul to what he loved most. For starters, he spent most of his hours and money maintaining their
                headquarters, which is the Great Tomb of Nazarick they worked so hard together to design in the past.
                After an intense 12-year run, YGGDRASIL, the online game lost the vibrancy it once have and eventually,
                it was scheduled to be shut down in due time.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the final day, <a href="/characters/ainz">Momonga</a> considerately send out several invitations
                to the remaining guild members
                who are semi-active. However, among those that did come apart from
                <a href="/characters/ainz">Momonga</a>, only one happens to answer
                his friend's invite when nobody else did, deciding to appear and stick with him for a short while longer
                before logging off. Though saddened by the fact that they had to part ways, he accepts the grim reality
                that his friends have real life situations to take care of above all than spend time playing video game.

            </p>
            <p class="extra hide">
                As the last sole player in the guild who was online, <a href="/characters/ainz">Momonga</a> decided to
                continue staying logged on for
                the remainder of the game's time left, choosing to fall asleep within the Throne Room until the server
                automatically boot him out. After the game finally shuts down, <a href="/characters/ainz">Momonga</a>
                later awoke to find himself still
                in the form of his heteromorphic avatar, an Overlord and a very powerful magic caster. Within Nazarick,
                he was then met with NPCs who suddenly shown to have a consciousness of their own right in front of him.
                In other words, he was actually transported into an entirely different New World as its own separate
                reality along with the various NPCs in Nazarick who have been brought to life after the transfer.
            </p>
            <p class="extra hide">
                Realizing the state and situation he is in where it's no longer a game,
                <a href="/characters/ainz">Momonga</a> effortlessly tried his
                attempts in using player functions, such as the chat, a GM call, or even a forced logout, but none of
                them seem to be accessible whatsoever anymore. With no other options left,
                <a href="/characters/ainz">Momonga</a> deliberates the idea
                of setting out on a long-term quest to learn whether anyone from YGGDRASIL had been sent into this New
                World besides him, refusing to believe that he was the only player to have been transported after
                experiencing the end of YGGDRASIL. Realizing what his next course of action will be: Having no parents,
                friends, or place in society, this ordinary young man, <a href="/characters/ainz">Momonga</a> has made
                it
                his objective to go outside
                the underground tomb to explore, investigate and conquer the vast unknown new world with the help of his
                subordinates from Nazarick. He goes by the name of Ainz Ooal Gown as a sign of respect to not only
                represent his former guild members who aren't there with him, but to also sent a clear message to any
                other players out there besides himself that may happen to recognize the so-called player.
                <a href="/characters/ainz">Momonga</a> step
                foot outside Nazarick and begun his exploration of the surrounding uncharted lands and regions in an
                attempt to figure out what has been transpiring until now. He search for anyone or anything that could
                help him unraveled the mystery of this world's magical norms and rules which sets it apart uniquely from
                YGGDRASIL.

            Great Tomb of Nazarick (ナザリック 地下大墳墓) is the guild headquarters of Ainz Ooal Gown, widely renowned for
            being an unconquerable dungeon throughout YGGDRASIL.
        </p>
        <p>
            Prior to Ainz Ooal Gown conquering this dungeon, the Great Tomb of Nazarick was originally set to have
            only six floors. After Ainz Ooal Gown conquered it, the dungeon was completely reconstructed and was
            stretched to over ten floors. For travel between floors, there are specific points on each floor, where
            gates open to allow magical transit. According to one of the Floor Guardians, one needs to take teleport
            gates at specific locations and go up level by level if they want to go from a lower Floor to an upper
            Floor.

                        most powerful NPCs.
                        Capture of the 8th Floor means that Ainz Ooal Gown's chances of victory are low. This floor
                        seems to be dangerous even to the NPCs of Nazarick as Ainz forbids them from entering the 8th
                        Floor; at
                        least one World Item exists here.

                        <b class="mobile">9th FLoor:</b> This floor contains Guild Members' and NPCs' rooms. It also
                        includes
                        imitations of
                        large communal baths, cafeterias, beauty salons, clothing stores, grocery stores, fitness
                        salons,
                        nail salons, and numerous other types of facility rooms. These facilities were originally just
                        for
                        decoration in YGGDRASIL, but they become real after the base's arrival in the New World.
                        According
                        to Ainz, it is arguably the floor with conditions most similar to that of the real world.

                        of Ainz Ooal Gown is necessary to enter the Treasury. On the other hand, the air in the Treasury
                        is toxic and thus, anyone without poison immunity or items granting it will die within three
                        steps.
