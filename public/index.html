            <p>
                The final hour of the popular virtual reality game Yggdrasil has come. However, <a href="/character/ainz">Momonga</a>, a powerful
                wizard and master of the dark guild Ainz Ooal Gown, decides to spend his last few moments in the game as
                the servers begin to shut down. To his surprise, despite the clock having struck midnight, <a href="/character/ainz">Momonga</a> is
                still fully conscious as his character and, moreover, the non-player characters appear to have developed
                personalities of their own!
            </p>
            <p>
                Confronted with this abnormal situation, <a href="/character/ainz">Momonga</a> commands his loyal servants to help him investigate and
                take control of this new world, with the hopes of figuring out what has caused this development and if
                there may be others in the same predicament.

        <article class="desktopSyn">
            <p>
                In the year 2138, where the era of virtual reality gaming is thriving with different DMMO-RPGs, gamers
                used
                what was called the Neural Nano-Interface which enabled them to get the experience in playing it. At the
                center of its popularity and heydays, was YGGDRASIL which garnered the most attention publicly. Within
                the
                game exists a guild organization known as, Ainz Ooal Gown, originally consisting of 41 members and
                credited
                as one of the top strongest guilds.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now with only 4 of the members left remaining in the guild, the other 37
                were said to have given up on the game and quit it in the end. Before a majority of his companions gone
                offline forever since, they gave away all of their precious equipment and items respectively to none
                other
                than their guild leader <a href="/character/ainz">Momonga</a> himself. <a href="/character/ainz">Momonga</a>, was considered to be the one and only guild member
                around
                who continues to actively play YGGDRASIL, dedicating his heart and soul to what he loved most. For
                starters,
                he spent most of his hours and money maintaining their headquarters, which is the Great Tomb of Nazarick
                they worked so hard together to design in the past. After an intense 12-year run, YGGDRASIL, the online
                game
                lost the vibrancy it once have and eventually, it was scheduled to be shut down in due time.
                During the final day, <a href="/character/ainz">Momonga</a> considerately send out several invitations to the remaining guild members
                who
                are semi-active. However, among those that did come apart from <a href="/character/ainz">Momonga</a>, only one happens to answer his
                friend's invite when nobody else did, deciding to appear and stick with him for a short while longer
                before
                logging off. Though saddened by the fact that they had to part ways, he accepts the grim reality that
                his
                friends have real life situations to take care of above all than spend time playing video game. As the
                last
                sole player in the guild who was online, <a href="/character/ainz">Momonga</a> decided to continue staying logged on for the remainder
                of
                the game's time left, choosing to fall asleep within the Throne Room until the server automatically boot
                him
                out. After the game finally shuts down, <a href="/character/ainz">Momonga</a> later awoke to find himself still in the form of his
                heteromorphic avatar, an Overlord and a very powerful magic caster. Within Nazarick, he was then met
                with
                NPCs who suddenly shown to have a consciousness of their own right in front of him. In other words, he
                was
                actually transported into an entirely different New World as its own separate reality along with the
                various
                NPCs in Nazarick who have been brought to life after the transfer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Realizing the state and situation he is in where it's no longer a game, <a href="/character/ainz">Momonga</a> effortlessly tried his
                attempts in using player functions, such as the chat, a GM call, or even a forced logout, but none of
                them
                seem to be accessible whatsoever anymore. With no other options left, <a href="/character/ainz">Momonga</a> deliberates the idea of
                setting out on a long-term quest to learn whether anyone from YGGDRASIL had been sent into this New
                World
                besides him, refusing to believe that he was the only player to have been transported after experiencing
                the
                end of YGGDRASIL. Realizing what his next course of action will be: Having no parents, friends, or place
                in
                society, this ordinary young man, <a href="/character/ainz">Momonga</a> has made it his objective to go outside the underground tomb
                to
                explore, investigate and conquer the vast unknown new world with the help of his subordinates from
                Nazarick.
                He goes by the name of Ainz Ooal Gown as a sign of respect to not only represent his former guild
                members
                who aren't there with him, but to also sent a clear message to any other players out there besides
                himself
                that may happen to recognize the so-called player. <a href="/character/ainz">Momonga</a> step foot outside Nazarick and begun his
                exploration of the surrounding uncharted lands and regions in an attempt to figure out what has been
                transpiring until now. He search for anyone or anything that could help him unraveled the mystery of
                this
                world's magical norms and rules which sets it apart uniquely from YGGDRASIL.
